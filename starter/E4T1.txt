# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

The first and most important change in my opinion is to redeploy web server instance in a private subnet. There is really no good reason for being able to route directly to this instance from the public internet when we have a load balancer for this purpose. The next change I would carry it out is to only allow inbound connection to the web server instance from the load balancer security group on port 5000, where application is served. 

The access to secret recipes bucket needs to be better protected as neither instance should have access to this bucket. This can be rectified by introducing a new IAM role that would have to be assumed in order to access this bucket.
