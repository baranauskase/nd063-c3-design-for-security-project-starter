# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

The web server instance still is hosted in the public subnet and has a public IP associated to it. This is generally bad practice and the attack surface can be significantly reduced by moving this instance to the private subnet and not associating a public IP to it.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

The IAM role that is associated with web server instance had a policy that was too open and allowed full access to all S3 buckets. This has been improved by reducing the scope to read only access of a free recipes bucket. So, in case of a successful breach where temporary credentials for this role are leaked, they would not grant the attacker access to secret recipe bucket anymore. A private endpoint improves the security posture from a perspective that we do not need to route to S3 from our VPC over public internet. However, if the attacker is within the VPC a leas privilege IAM roles are paramount.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

Applying default encryption to the S3 bucket does not force the encryption of existing objects automatically. 

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The changes Iâ€™ve made to improve the security posture so far were by modifying the CloudFormation templates and updating the stacks. It is not a good practice to perform out-of-band fixes, as in these cases we would need to detect drift and change templates accordingly before they are safe to use in updating the stacks.
